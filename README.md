## Introduction
##
Kahoo is an Android app that has several features like the Twitter app, such as for new tweets there is a Kahoo option, for retweets there is Kahoo Dobara, hashtags,trendinghashtags, mentions, follow & followers, etc. I used FFmpeg for the video compressing and optimizing. I used firebase firestore as a backend for this project.

## This project need more features, any helpful contributions are welcomed, you are open to fork it and try it on your own.
